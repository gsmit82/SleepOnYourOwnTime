<h3>Being a Father</h3>
<p>Kobe was not just a rolemodel for athletes, he was a rolemodel for his kids most of all. Kobe love for his daughters was never a question. Gianna and Kobe were often seen laughing or talking basketball strategies on the side of the court during NBA games. He loved his daughters and knew that were strong. Kobe recalled in an interview one time when he was asked by a fan if he was upset with not having a boy to continue his legacy, Gianna turned around and told the fan "Don't worry I got this" </p>
